Apologies for the late delivery, there's really no excuse, I just wanted to get things done right, but I've failed to adequately complete some of the tasks

There is not much to share, during the winter break, I watched some youtube videos regarding proper coding, and camera movements, which is why i believe the raycast hits was done in a acceptable manner
the respawning of food was challening, it was my very first time using Lerps, for taht i utilize some youtube videos
