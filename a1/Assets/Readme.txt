Ayden's informal biography on assigment 1.


list of changes.

1.added jump animation and strafe animation from mixamo
2. added stafe mechanic which locks rotation and triggers the strafe animation
3. use layer masks, linear interpolation, and raycasts to prevent objects from ocluding the player
4.use coroutines, vector3 math and linear interpolation to move the food below the map becoming inacessable, then to slowly raise it up and with a bool statement reactivate it allowing the player to pick it up again
5. cried, blood sweat and tears, and much help from youtube, owen, unity docs, and stackoverflow.
