Hi Sean!

Please reference .../Scenes/SampleScenes for the functionality, as my camera code does not work in NatureScene!



Going through the tasks in order:

===TASK 1===
If you're reading this, then hopefully that means I did task 1 correctly! Sorry if the branch name isn't quite right!

===TASK 2===
For this, I got some slight help from Cade in terms of implementing the strafing function to the PlayerController.
...Though, really, it was just commenting out a single line of code. The implementation could have been much more in-depth!

===TASK 3===
I did not receive any help for this one! 
Though, looking back, I probably could have saved myself a headache by just fading in the pickup AFTER the respawn timer finishes...

===TASK 4===
Off the top of my head, I think I asked Owen, Ryan, and Christian questions about how they made their camera. I don't think I used much of what they did, though.
Side note: My camera sucks ass, but it's really the best I can do right now. I understand if you choose to give me low marks for this!



This assignment was very, very challenging! Going into it, I felt very confident in what I knew, but now I feel like I know absolutely nothing.
I hope that I will be able to improve my programming skills and knowledge as the semester continues!
